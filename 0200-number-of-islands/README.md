# 0200 - Number of Islands

## Problem
Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

## Key Insight
Each island can be counted by finding a land cell that has not been visited yet and then flooding all land connected to it.

That makes depth-first search or breadth-first search a natural fit.

## Approach
Scan every cell in the grid.

- When you find an unvisited `'1'`, increment the island count.
- Run DFS from that cell to mark the entire connected component as visited.
- Replace visited land with `'0'` so it is not counted again.

## Why It Works
Every island is a connected component of land cells.

The first time a land cell from a component is encountered, the flood-fill marks every cell in that component, so the same island is never counted twice.

## Complexity
- Time: `O(mn)`
- Space: `O(mn)` in the worst case for recursion

## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        if not grid:
            return 0

        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])

        def dfs(r, c):
            if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r][c] == '0':
                return

            grid[r][c] = '0'
            dfs(r + 1, c)
            dfs(r - 1, c)
            dfs(r, c + 1)
            dfs(r, c - 1)

        islands = 0
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '1':
                    islands += 1
                    dfs(r, c)

        return islands
```

## Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        int islands = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                    islands++;
                    dfs(grid, r, c);
                }
            }
        }

        return islands;
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length || c < 0 || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] == '0') {
            return;
        }

        grid[r][c] = '0';
        dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
        dfs(grid, r, c - 1);
    }
}
```

## C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty() || grid[0].empty()) {
            return 0;
        }

        int rows = (int)grid.size();
        int cols = (int)grid[0].size();
        int islands = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                    islands++;
                    dfs(grid, r, c);
                }
            }
        }

        return islands;
    }

private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || r >= (int)grid.size() || c < 0 || c >= (int)grid[0].size() || grid[r][c] == '0') {
            return;
        }

        grid[r][c] = '0';
        dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
